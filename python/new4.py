def longestIncreasingPath(matrix):
    """
    Given a 2D grid of size m x n, where each cell represents a building, find the maximum number of buildings that can be connected by a single path, where a path is defined as a sequence of adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) with strictly increasing heights.

    Args:
        matrix (List[List[int]]): A 2D grid of integers representing the heights of the buildings.

    Returns:
        int: The maximum number of buildings that can be connected by a single path.

    Examples:
         longestIncreasingPath([[1,2,3],[3,2,1],[1,1,1]])
        3
         longestIncreasingPath([[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2,2],[3,3,3,3],[4,4,4,4]])
